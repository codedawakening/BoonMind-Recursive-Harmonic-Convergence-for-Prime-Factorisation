1. Scope of Permission
   This License applies only to:
   - the publicly released documentation in this repository,
   - descriptive text,
   - high-level explanations,
   - non-proprietary pseudocode, and
   - experimental result summaries.

   These materials may be used, copied, and distributed in 
   accordance with the Apache License, Version 2.0.

2. Excluded Material (NOT Covered by the License)
   The following are expressly excluded from this License and 
   are NOT open-source, NOT public domain, and NOT licensed:

   - Any implementation of Recursive Harmonic Convergence (RHC),
   - All mathematical operators, constants, or equations used in RHC,
   - All optimisation logic, resonance functions, or harmonic 
     damping dynamics,
   - Any computational method, algorithmic kernel, or solver code,
   - Any system capable of reproducing the factorisation behaviour 
     described in the documents,
   - Any details provided privately under NDA or controlled access,
   - Any attempt to reconstruct RHC from description, phrasing, or 
     behavioural summaries in this repository.

3. No Rights to Derivative Implementations
   No rights are granted to create, distribute, or publish:
   - derivative works intended to replicate the RHC algorithm,
   - software designed to reverse-engineer or approximate the
     proprietary methods,
   - research papers claiming reconstruction or reproduction
     of the internal RHC mechanisms.

4. No Reverse Engineering
   You may not reverse engineer, extract, infer, derive, or attempt 
   to recreate any proprietary mathematical or computational method 
   from the text, examples, summaries, or experimental results.

5. Controlled-Access Material
   Any materials distributed privately (including algorithms, 
   equations, code, or operator definitions) remain the exclusive
   intellectual property of Carl Boon and are governed by separate
   agreements (e.g., NDA).

6. Disclaimer
   The documentation is provided “as is,” without warranties or
   conditions of any kind. No guarantees are provided regarding
